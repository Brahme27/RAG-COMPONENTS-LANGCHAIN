    "# CharacterTextSplitter \n",
    "is a tool that splits text into chunks based purely on the number of characters, without worrying about words, sentences, or paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. separator (default: \"\\n\\n\")\n",
    "What it does: Tells the splitter where to break the text first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If set to \" \", it splits at spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set to \"\" if you want to split purely by characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. chunk_size (default: 1000)\n",
    "What it does: The maximum number of characters allowed in each chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the text is longer, it will be broken into smaller chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. chunk_overlap (default: 200)\n",
    "What it does: How many characters from the end of one chunk should be repeated at the beginning of the next chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps preserve context between chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. length_function (default: len)\n",
    "What it does: Function used to calculate the length of each chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize this if you're counting tokens instead of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (using tiktoken): length_function = lambda x: len(tokenizer.encode(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. is_separator_regex (default: False)\n",
    "What it does: Tells LangChain whether your separator is a regex pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "If True, the separator will be treated as a regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: separator = r\"\\s+\" will split on all whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works:\n",
    "You tell it:\n",
    "\n",
    "How many characters per chunk you want (e.g., 100).\n",
    "\n",
    "How much overlap you want between chunks (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it just cuts the text like a knife, every N characters, even if that cuts a word or sentence in half.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "Behavior                \t Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Default  \tFirst splits on \\n\\n, then trims based on character limits\n",
    "\n",
    "2) separator=\"\"\t              Forces it to split purely by character count\n"
